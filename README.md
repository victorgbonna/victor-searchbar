This was an search assignment given to me. 

Basically you will be given a search query and a variable - of any data type to search from. 

The task is to type a function that will loop through the search variable and return the variable path the search query is located at. 

The tricky part is that the search variable can be of any data type and incase so, put in the index of the path.

I believe it is working because I have ran about 4 distinct tests on it and confirmed. Comments are there for easy readability
